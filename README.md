# Vanessa.nvim

![Vanessa Colorscheme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/l0wigh/vanessa.nvim/master/vanessa.nvim.jpg)

Finally I made my own colorscheme for Neovim

# The name ?

It's called Vanessa beacause the person that helped me choose colors is called Vanessa.

Thanks to her btw.

# Installation

Use your favorite package manager to install that theme.
It requires Lush.nvim to be working, so make sure to install it too.


For packer.nvim just install it like that :

```lua
use { 'L0Wigh/vanessa.nvim', requires = {'rktjmp/lush.nvim'} }
```

# What is working

- nvim-cmp
- tree-sitter
- lualine
